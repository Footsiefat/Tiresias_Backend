# Tiresias_Backend
#### Repo for my work on the tiresias(backend part) project. Currently unfinished but feel free to have a look.
## Current Status: Alpha
### Most of core features of this program works but not all features have been added and documentation may be scarse.


## Main Focus/Goal:
### This project is meant to be an efficent and easy to use backend that focuses on being, Secure, Anonymous and Decentralised.

#### To get started all you need is a bootstrap server which helps nodes/users find each other. Think of them like trackers for torrents. 

#### Also for developers who just want to test this, is there is bootstrap server pre-built in(Hosted on my spare laptop lol).
